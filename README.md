# oibsip_3_todo_list
I have developed a Web app of To do list as part of my internship program.

This repository consists of source code and results of the To Do list Web application which I have developed as part of my Internship at Oasis Infobyte.

Oasis Infobyte is a Tech company providing various IT services and several internship opportunities to undergrads. I have developed this project as part of the Web Development internship. This is one of the tasks assigned to me during my internship period.

In the development of this project, I have used technologies such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript which play a major role in developing the websites.

HTML - HyperText Markup Language. CSS - Cascading Style Sheets.
